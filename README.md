# OmadaSimulatedDatasets
The two simulated datasets generated for Omada publication

1. *Single-class_RNAseq_100x100_dataset*: A single-class dataset of 100 samples and 100 genes drawn from a single distribution generated using Omada's function feasibilityAnalysis().

Code used: fa = feasibilityAnalysis(classes = 1, samples = 100, features = 100).
dataset1 = fa$generated.dataset


2. *Multi-class_RNAseq_359x300_dataset* : A multi-class dataset with 359 samples and 300 genes based on the contents and dimensions of the original RNA-seq data used in https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-27326-0. This dataset was generated by Omada's function feasibilityAnalysisDataBased().

Code used: fa = feasibilityAnalysisDataBased(data, classes = 3) # data represents the PAH dataset (refer to https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27326-0)
dataset2 = fa$generated.dataset
