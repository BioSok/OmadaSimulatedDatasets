# OmadaSimulatedDatasets
The two simulated datasets generated for Omada publication

1. Single-class_RNAseq_100x100_dataset: A single-class dataset of 100 samples and 100 genes drawn from a single distribution generated using Omada's function feasibilityAnalysis().

2. Multi-class_RNAseq_359x300_dataset : A multi-class dataset with 359 samples and 300 genes based on the contents and dimensions of the original RNA-seq data used in https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-27326-0. This dataset was generated by Omada's function feasibilityAnalysisDataBased().
